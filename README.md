# 🤖 Higress Report Generation Agent: An Intelligent Assistant for Automating Open Source Monthly Reports and Changelogs

## 📖 Project Background

In the daily maintenance of open source projects, regularly generating monthly reports and changelogs is essential. Traditionally, developers need to manually filter PRs, analyze code changes, and write feature descriptions. This process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to missing important information.

**Higress Report Generation Agent** was created to address this. It is an AI-powered intelligent report generation system that automatically analyzes PR data from GitHub repositories and generates high-quality monthly reports and changelogs.
